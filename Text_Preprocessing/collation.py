""" collation.py
    Author: Mike Graziano
    This code is used to extract only clinical documents from the 
    test_text.txt file that has a classification.
    This is done due to the fact that the original data had false 
    information for the purposes of the contest. The solution was
    provided at a later date and we would like to use these exact 
    values in our project.
